                  Social networks like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook have grown to have billions of users. In fact in todayâ€™s society, it is necessary or nearly expected to use one if not all of these technological communication networks. The increasing use of social networking has had both a negative and positive effect on communication in relationships. The purpose of this literary analysis is to answer if social networks are helpful or harmful to relationships. As social networking evolves, different aspects of communication suffer.
                  With the expedient process of getting to know someone, relationships can rise and fall much quicker. Aside from expediting relationships, there is the factor of getting to know someone for who they really are.
                  All of sudden,  a person's life will never give you an accurate represtation of reailty. we create the image that we want to convey through our activity on social media. Needless to say, it's much easier to convey the reality that we want to portray on internet then to live in real life. "/>
